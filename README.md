# portfolio-tt-jsfl
JavaScript for Adobe Animate modules that automate processes for the Production team. Some of these tasks would take hours per Animate file and were prone to error. Automation scripts can process dozens of files within minutes.

## Input
Files were usually gathered in a directory for processing and then opened in Adobe Animate, where the JSFL script would be executed.

## Output
Provide various outputs depending on the task. Some of these include: 

1. Converted Animate Files that could be uploaded as DLC for the Math 4.0 apps
2. MySQL queries to migrate file data to our servers
3. Extract reusable Animate assets to be embedded in the Apache Flex app
